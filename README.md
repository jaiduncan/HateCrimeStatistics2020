# U.S. Hate Crime Data 2020

---

## Project Brief

---

### Purpose

This project is to help determine the types of hate crimes occuring in the U.S. I'll use the data to determine the area of the country with the highest and lowest reports, taking into account that not all crimes are reported. I'll also be looking at the crimes reported in the state of Kentucky. 

---

### Features Used 

#### **Read two sets of data from CSV files or API**

This is still to be determined as of now but I'll be using data pulled from the FBI Crime Data Explorer website.

#### **Clean the data and perform a pandas merge with the data sets**


#### **Use Tableau to chart the data**


#### **Reaching out to a mentor will help me to determine the best course of action for my best practices feature. I hope to utilize a virtual environment and will detail tell how to set this up**

### Interpretation

My hope is that this project can be used to determine what areas of the country can be provided with better outreach, education and counseling to lower the hate crime rates.
